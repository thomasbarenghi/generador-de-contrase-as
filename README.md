# Password Generator

During my apprenticeship as a programmer, I developed a password generator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of web programming and create a useful tool for users looking to generate strong passwords. The application allows the user to select the desired length of the password and choose between letters, numbers and special characters to create personalized passwords. Furthermore, this project allowed me to improve my skills in interface design and the implementation of interactive functions in a web page.
